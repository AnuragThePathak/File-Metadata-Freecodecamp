# [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

- This is my solution to the [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice) challenge in the freeCodeCamp API and Microservices track.
- The challenge is to create a Node.js application that will take in a file path and return the file's metadata. The file's metadata includes the file size, creation date, modification date, and extension.
